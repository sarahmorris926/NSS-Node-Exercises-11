# NSS-Node-Exercises-11
NSS Node.JS Exercises: 11 - SQL Queries

## Instructions

1. Open up the database file in the *DB Browser for SQLite* application to see it
1. Copy and paste the queries below into your `queries.sql` file and comment them out. Then you can write a query for each requrement and refer back to them later as a resource
1. When you have written a query, paste it into DB Browser and test it by clicking the tab labeled "Execute SQL"

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Everything from class and the [Sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/) documentation for SQL [keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) and [functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html) is fair game.

1. Query all of the entries in the `Genre` table
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add one of your favorite artists to the `Artist` table.
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add one, or more, albums by your artist to the `Album` table.
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add some songs that are on that album to the `Song` table.
1. Write a `SELECT` query that provides the song titles, album title, and artist name for all of the data you just entered in. Use the [`LEFT JOIN`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-using-joins.htm) keyword sequence to connect the tables, and the `WHERE` keyword to filter the results to the album and artist you added. Here is some more info on [joins](http://www.dofactory.com/sql/join) that might help.
    > **Reminder:** Direction of join matters. Try the following statements and see the difference in results.

    ```
    SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Album a LEFT JOIN Song s ON s.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;
    SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Song s LEFT JOIN Album a ON s.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;
    ```
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each album. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each artist. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each genre. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Using `MAX()` function, write a select statement to find the album with the longest duration. The result should display the album title and the duration.
1. Using `MAX()` function, write a select statement to find the song with the longest duration. The result should display the song title and the duration.
1. Modify the previous query to also display the title of the album.
